## About
For my project, I created two Jupyter Notebooks, a web scraping tutorial for the [Wellesley College Honors Theses Digital Repository](https://repository.wellesley.edu/collections/thesiscollection) and a data exploration for the dataset created in the web scraping tutorial. This repository consits of three key files listed below for easy access.
