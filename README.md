# Wellesley College Honors Theses 

This is a repository for the Wellesley Data Collective Project in January 2021. For my project, I created two Jupyter Notebooks, a web scraping tutorial for the Wellesley College Honors Theses Digital Repository and a data exploration for the dataset created in the web scraping tutorial. This repository consits of three key files listed below for easy access.
