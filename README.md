# Wellesley College Honors Theses 

This is a repository for the Wellesley Data Collective Project in January 2021. This repo is accompanied by a [Wellesley College Honors Theses Website](https://marisapapagelis.github.io/wdc-honors-theses/) that I created using HTML.

## About
For my project, I created two Jupyter Notebooks, a web scraping tutorial for the [Wellesley College Honors Theses Digital Repository](https://repository.wellesley.edu/collections/thesiscollection) and a data exploration for the dataset created in the web scraping tutorial. This repository consits of three key files listed below for easy access. 

## Notebooks 

The notebooks I created can be found in the repository under the following names: 
* Honors_Theses_Scraping_Tutorial.ipynb
* Honors_Theses_Exploration.ipynb

The dataset that was created using the scraping notebook is availble as a json file: 
* WellesleyHonorsTheses.json
